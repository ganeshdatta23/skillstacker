# üìö SkillStacker API Documentation - Complete Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive API documentation for SkillStacker! This guide explains every endpoint in detail with examples that beginners can understand.

## üéØ What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is like a waiter in a restaurant:
- You (the frontend) tell the waiter (API) what you want
- The waiter goes to the kitchen (backend/database) to get it
- The waiter brings back your order (data) in a nice format

## üåê Base URLs

| Environment | URL | When to Use |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| **Development** | `http://localhost:8000` | When running locally |
| **Production** | `https://your-domain.com` | When deployed online |

## üîë Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication. Here's how it works:

### 1. Register a New User
```http
POST /api/v1/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "secure123",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "user": {
    "customer_id": 123,
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "activebool": true,
    "is_admin": false
  }
}
```

### 2. Login Existing User
```http
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "secure123"
}
```

### 3. Using the Token
Include the token in all future requests:
```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

## üö® Error Handling

### Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning | When It Happens |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **200** | Success | Request worked perfectly |
| **201** | Created | New resource was created |
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid input data |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Need to login first |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist |
| **422** | Validation Error | Data format is wrong |
| **500** | Server Error | Something went wrong on our end |

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "detail": "Film not found"
}
```

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. "Film not found" (404)
**Problem:** Trying to access a film that doesn't exist
**Solution:** Check the film ID is correct

#### 2. "Invalid search term" (400)
**Problem:** Search term contains invalid characters
**Solution:** Use only letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens

#### 3. "MongoDB unavailable" (503)
**Problem:** MongoDB database is not running
**Solution:** Start MongoDB with `docker-compose up -d`

#### 4. "Validation error" (422)
**Problem:** Data doesn't match expected format
**Solution:** Check required fields and data types

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Using cURL (Command Line)

#### Create a Film
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/unified/films" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "title=Test Movie&description=A test film&rating=PG-13"
```

#### Search for Films
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/unified/search?q=test&category=films"
```

#### Get Statistics
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/unified/stats"
```

### Using JavaScript (Frontend)

#### Create a Film
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/unified/films', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  },
  body: 'title=Test Movie&description=A test film&rating=PG-13'
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

#### Search
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/unified/search?q=action');
const results = await response.json();
console.log(results);
```

### Using Python (Backend/Scripts)

#### Create a Film
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'http://localhost:8000/unified/films',
    data={
        'title': 'Test Movie',
        'description': 'A test film',
        'rating': 'PG-13'
    }
)

print(response.json())
```

#### Search
```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:8000/unified/search',
    params={'q': 'action', 'category': 'films'}
)

print(response.json())
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Pagination
When dealing with lots of data, use pagination:

```http
# Get first 10 results
GET /unified/search?q=movie&limit=10&skip=0

# Get next 10 results
GET /unified/search?q=movie&limit=10&skip=10

# Get results 21-30
GET /unified/search?q=movie&limit=10&skip=20
```

### Filtering by Category
```http
# Only search films
GET /unified/search?q=action&category=films

# Only search actors
GET /unified/search?q=smith&category=actors

# Only search reviews
GET /unified/search?q=great&category=reviews
```

### Partial Updates
You can update just specific fields:

```http
# Only update the title
PUT /unified/films/123
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

title=New Title

# Only update the rating
PUT /unified/films/123
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

rating=R

# Update multiple fields
PUT /unified/films/123
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

title=New Title&rating=R&rental_rate=6.99
```

- **[Source Code](./backend/src/api/unified_data.py)**: See how it's implemented

## üí° Tips for Success

### For Beginners
1. **Start with GET requests** - they're safe and don't change data
2. **Use the interactive docs** at http://localhost:8000/docs
3. **Test one endpoint at a time** before combining them
4. **Read error messages carefully** - they usually tell you what's wrong

### For Developers
1. **Always handle errors** in your code
2. **Use appropriate HTTP methods** (GET for reading, POST for creating, etc.)
3. **Validate input data** before sending requests
4. **Implement retry logic** for network failures
5. **Cache frequently accessed data** for better performance

### Best Practices
1. **Use HTTPS in production** for security
2. **Include authentication tokens** for protected endpoints
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Log API calls** for debugging and monitoring
5. **Version your APIs** for backward compatibility

**Happy API exploring! üöÄ**

Remember: The best way to learn APIs is to use them. Start with simple GET requests and gradually work your way up to more complex operations!
